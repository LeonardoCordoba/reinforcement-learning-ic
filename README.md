### **Gastón Bujía** - **Leonardo Córdoba**

In this repo we uploaded some code related to a Reinforcement Learning postgraduate course at University of Buenos Aires, taught by Matthieu Jonckheere.

The code is organized as follows:

- recycling_robots: exercise in which Bellman's equation is used to solve Recyling Robot problem (Sutton).

- bandits: traditional multi-armed bandits problem solved using different algorithms (Sutton).

- model_free: Montecarlo, SARSA and Q-learning algorithms are used to solve a variation of Perudo game.
